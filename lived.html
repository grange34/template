		<h1>How Technology Influences Careers</h1>
		
<p>	Science and technology have been very influential for many people throughout their lives and throughout numerous careers. As for me, it isn’t just an important influence; it forms the basis to my major and is a way of life for my future career. Technology has allowed me to learn so much more about what I want to do in my life and has been associated with every experience that has led me to my decision in choosing my major. Human biology revolves around and relies on technology to make new discoveries and help people through certain sicknesses and diseases. Witnessing people’s lives being saved and lives being lost made me want to take part in the process and better it. </p>
<p>Choosing human biology as my major was honestly an easy decision for me. Ever since I was little I knew that I wanted to go into the medical field in some type of way, all I wanted to do was help people. Understandably, many people choose this career path and tend to change it throughout their time in college or even afterwards, however, I am very certain I have the ability and motivation to stick with it. I’ve grown up surrounded with constantly having to go to hospitals for people, and I’ve seen the worst of what could happen in medical situations and I’ve seen the best results there could be. I had to learn real fast that anything could occur within the medical field and to always be prepared for the worst, but when I was about 10 I met a physician’s assistant that had the most optimistic outlook I had seen in a hospital and it rubbed off on his patients and lifted their spirits. I immediately knew that’s what I wanted to do, help people physically and mentally and keep a positive outlook on life no matter the situation.  Becoming a physician’s assistant is what I was meant to do and falls under a major that is known for helping and saving countless lives.</p>
<p>	Technology is such an important part in the health sciences field it is hard to choose just one piece that has influenced my decision to go into the human biology major. I would say that the tools they use in anesthesia such as the oxygen masks, anesthetic vapors, and anesthetic machine, etc. is what made me first interested in the medical field. They are involved in every surgery from miniscule to major emergencies. It relieves the pain or makes someone feel no pain at all and I was amazed that it could help so much and was intrigued by it. There are greater surgeries and transplants that made me want to become a physician’s assistant, than just the idea of anesthesia, however, I realized that those surgeries that saved lives and helped people all rooted from them not being able to feel pain through the anesthesia. This type of technology is what first sparked my interest as a young girl in the medical field, probably because I saw it used so much in my personal experiences and watching it help my family and friends in their surgeries as well.</p>
	<p>In the past, I have had a couple run-ins with anesthesia and the tools used to work it. When I was around five years old I had to get a surgery done on my tongue and received the drug to put me out so I would feel no pain and it would be easier on me. Looking back on that moment, the doctors were so calm and reassuring while I was going into surgery I wasn’t nervous at all. Being able to make a person, especially a child, not nervous for a surgery is a difficult task and they made it all go so smoothly, that’s what I want to do for others when I get older.  I looked at that experience and realized that due to the combination of technology and doctors and nurses that helped me at that time, I really wanted to make that difference in others lives.</p>
<p>I have also witnessed how anesthesia has affected others close to me and made their surgeries and operations more comfortable and easier to go through and it really is spectacular. My stepdad had cancer for 7 years and went through numerous operations because of it, and was relieved of pain through the tools used to give him that drug.   He’s honestly the reason I chose to pursue becoming a physician’s assistant, because I saw how his physician’s assistant got to know him throughout his chemo- therapy and lifted his spirits the whole process. </p>
<p>All in all, science and technology are a very influential part of many people’s lives, it definitely has changed mine and made a significant difference.  Anesthesia and the tools that help deliver it had a large impact on why I chose to go into the medical field, especially human biology. Technology is the base to my major and my chosen career and without it doctors and physician’s assistants wouldn’t be able to save half as many lives or make lives as easy.  I am constantly amazed at the things technology can do and learn more from it every day.</p>
