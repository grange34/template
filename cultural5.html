<p>The solution to this problem isn’t as simple as some may think. Making cleaner music videos and less degrading songs is definitely a start, but it cannot be the solution alone. The damage is ultimately done; our generation and society have already been exposed to the demeaning videos and lyrics that have placed a certain image in their heads. Therefore, taking the cause away is not going to remove the effect that’s has been caused; there is not just a one step solution to a societal problem like this. People’s views entirely need to alter; men need to start respecting women and not treating them as objects and refrain from referring to them as “bitches” and “hoes”.  As a result, if men aren’t giving women attention for being promiscuous their actions will stop as well. If men respect women and expect lady like actions from them, it will rub off and women will start acting like ladies again. Also, if women only act like ladies, men won’t have a choice but to respect them because if they don’t, then the woman will find a man that does. The solution lies in altering the way videos are made, songs are written, and most importantly the changing of the view points of the people exposed and also in the changing of their behavior. </p>
