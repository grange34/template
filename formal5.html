			<p>Economically, the medical field is exceptional to go into. There are always jobs available, because people are constantly getting sick and need help. It is not like the business majors where it can be hit or miss and take years to work your way up to a decent paying job. Even then the majority of business majors don?t make it to a good paying job, you have to know the right people and have connections to make it anywhere. Realistically, having connections are obviously important in any major or career path, but the medical field is based primarily on the education you have and how well you are at your job. Hospitals want doctors that are going to work efficiently and are the best, you?re dealing with lives and knowledge and ability actually count for something. The medical field goes through a lot more schooling than any other major, and therefore that means more money is spent on that schooling but in the long run the medical school students come out on top. They have their whole lives to pay back loans, which within a few years of becoming physician?s assistants, nurses, doctors, surgeons, etc. they could easily pay off. Unless you somehow make it famous in the entertainment industry, become a CEO or CFO, or are a big time lawyer, the medical field is the way to go economically and especially if you want a job right out of school. People with degrees in medicine are constantly in demand, and it is the smart way educationally and economically to go. </p>
