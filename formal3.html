			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>   To get more information on Physician?s Assistants and become more knowledgeable about the career I decided to look up a few articles on the job descriptions, personal experiences, and educational necessities. Reading through these and studying what they have to offer has made me more confident in my choice of career, and can easily help many other young adults looking for more information. The article ?Physician Assistant Career Profile and Overview? written by Andrea Santiago is on about.com and provides a lot of helpful tips and facts that are useful.  The true definition of a PA is revealed and how it varies from state to state, due to the fact that their ability to practice depends on the state law in which they are practicing. In most states, physician?s assistants must practice while under supervision from a physician. However, there are other cases in different states where physician assistants can see patients and charge them for office hours, allowing the office to run with less physicians and more efficiently. This article also includes information on how long schooling would take and what would increase students chances of getting into PA school. You need a bachelor?s degree along with a master?s degree in physician assisting , to beat out competition easier for the spot in PA school it would be best to have a bachelor?s degree in a science. The salary is obviously a major part in picking a job or career, and if I do say so myself, the Physician?s Assistant field isn?t too shabby to go into. In primary care, the average income is about $84,236 and if you specialize in surgical care the salary will be approximately $97,207. Benefits after retirement would also include an extra $6,000 to $7,000 per year.

			<p> ?The Washington Post? had another great article about teaching people the difference between a nurse practitioner and a physician?s assistant. There is no specific author to this article, however it is properly titled ?Nurse Practitioner vs. Physician?s Assistant?.  The two jobs do share a lot of the same general characteristics like their work environments, their abilities to treat illnesses, and how they interact with their patients. The difference isn?t in their daily jobs but in their training and job background, it deals more with how the medical information they?ve learned is obtained. Physician?s Assistants typically have a master?s degree and must follow a medical type of model for their training.  Nurses technically tend to go through more training and experience before they actually go through practionership. NP?s also always need previous nursing degrees to even get into graduate programs and need professional experiences before they enter school, while physician?s assistants go through the standard bachelor?s degree and continue on with 2 years of PA school. Both careers require multiple exams taken and are usually fully licensed. </p>
