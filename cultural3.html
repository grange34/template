<p>To support and verify my stand on this issue, I went to YouTube and Google and found numerous songs that are degrading towards women. Some of the worst songs include “Bitches Ain’t Shit” by Snoop Dogg, “Wildflower” by Ghostface Killah, “Heidi Hoe” by Common, “U.O.E.N.O.” by Rick Ross, and  “I Wanna Love You” by Akon, but the unedited version. These songs have been noted on top ten most degrading lists and on the dirtiest rap songs ever lists. The lyrics are just repulsive and even the song titles alone give you a clue of how the song is going to play out. “U.O.E.N.O.” is one of the most popular rap songs of 2013 that many teenagers know the lyrics to and sing along to at concerts and on the radio. In the lyrics it says “…put Molly all in her champagne, she ain’t even know it, I took her home and enjoyed that, she ain’t even know it…” talking about the latest date rape drug, Molly, and how it’s basically socially acceptable to drug girls at parties or bars and take advantage of them. Lyrics like these make it look okay to disrespect and engage in such horrible illegal activity. In the song “Bitches Ain’t Shit” Snoop Dogg insults women throughout the entire song for no reason, the lyrics “Bitches ain’t shit but hoes and tricks, lick on these n*** and suck the d***, get the f*** out after you’re done…”. This song is very well known, and the saying is still constantly use, the fact that the tune is catchy doesn’t help the matter either, and half the time people sing it without even realizing what they are saying. It’s a song that consistently puts down women and treats them as objects only good for doing sexual favors.  “I Wanna Love You” is also one of the songs that my generation still likes gives attention to. Akon only talks about how he throws money at the stripper he’s looking at and how he only wants to hook up with her. Putting strippers in songs and saying how hot they are does not put a good image or idea in girls minds, thinking they need to be promiscuous and slutty to get guys attention. </p>
<p>Music videos, along with songs help prove my point as well. Within the past couple months, articles have been written about how these days videos are so degrading and misleading with and towards women. “Blurred Lines” by Robin Thicke has received a lot of criticism for his music video due to the fact that it portrays the girls to look dumb, not say a word, dance around provocatively, and get checked out by the artists. It makes it appear that women are only there to look pretty and behave the way men want them to.  There are many critical reviews of this music video in particular, but videos in general have reached a whole new level of raunchiness lately. Websites all over the internet have their own takes on this issue but one quote stood out to me "In music videos across the board there's widespread racism and sexism, specifically the sexualisation of black and ethnic minority women," says Lia Latchford of Rewind&Reframe. "Young women have told us that it has a real impact on their day-to-day lives. They're tired of messages that depict women as highly sexualized passive sex objects. Getting rid of one song won't solve the problem. It's a culture of racism and sexism that we need to change." (www.theguardian.com). This quote shows that many women are tired of being depicted as objects and want a change, and they realize that music videos and their lyrics are is what’s degrading them. </p>
