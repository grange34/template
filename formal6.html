			<p>The figure below shows the percentile of physician?s assistants that receive certain hourly wages and annual wages as well. This figure can give people a perspective of the average range that a PA makes, but it also gives you an example of what you could be making if you work hard and set your goals high. Being in the 90th percentile is a great accomplishment, that you obviously are rewarded for through your salary. Even starting out in this field you are able to make a decent amount of money, a lot more than the majority of jobs offered now a days.  This chart is a good example of representing all different areas and levels of physician?s assistants, it appears as if the 10th percentile is what you make as a starting out PA and the salaries increase as your experience increases. The chart below is definitely a good and reliable representative of the statistics for salaries of physician?s assistants in the U.S. I got my figure through the Bureau of Labor Statistics located at http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes291071.htm.

<p>    This pie chart represents the various types of specialties that you can go into after schooling and basic PA school. It shows the numerous possibilities that are offered, and the amount of the population of students that go into each type of specific area in medicine. Many people might not be aware that there are this many areas you can go into after PA school, so they pick something well known and basic that they might not truly be interested in. This pie chart allows people to view choices and find a specific area in the medical field that they can relate to and care about.  The chart also gives its viewers an idea of what major areas that most people go into, and is very helpful in learning about the amount of areas you can go into and the various options to pick from after PA school.  I received this pie chart and statistic from http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/medicalschool/education/degree_programs/PAProgram/program/Pages/GraduateStatistics.aspx and it was very helpful in my research evaluating the different areas and field that?s physician?s assistants can go into. I would, without a doubt, advise students to look into the chart and research their options.
