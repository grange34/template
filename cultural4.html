<p>The main issue that comes from music videos and their lyrics being so descriptive and degrading is the view men and teenagers are beginning to have of women and their expectations. Besides the fact that it’s disrespectful and just plain rude to speak about women in such a manner, it gives men an unrealistic view of women and portrays them as objects and not as people. They are beginning to expect and want women to act like the girls in the videos, men want girls to be promiscuous and slutty and encourage that behavior like it’s a normal every day thing. The sad part about all of it is that girls are starting to conform to these standards, they no longer have respect for themselves and don’t act like ladies. It’s beginning to seem like women aren’t even treated as equals any more, just utilized for sex and to be talked down to.  Our generation is changing before our eyes, and not for the better, I can only imagine what the future generations will look like if music and its videos stay the way they are. </p>
