<p>At the end of the day, there are many issues in society at this moment in time, but the way music, including it’s lyrics and videos, degrade women and affect our generations views is extremely important. Teenagers value their music greatly now a day, and they take hints from the music and apply it to their lives. By songs degrading women, it makes it look like it’s okay to treat them as objects and therefore gives women a reason to behave in a way that’s not respectful to themselves. Due to these popular songs and the affect they’re having, our generation is changing, and not for the better. There needs to be a change, and it needs to happen fast. </p>
