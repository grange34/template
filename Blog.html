                <p>The purpose of the video was for a man to be able to get his word across to the world that it hurts to be harassed and judged for something you can’t help. How the feeling of being shunned and unwanted by your own family is the worst feeling and how alone it makes you feel. But he wanted to let his late uncle know that it wasn’t fair for him to take the easy way out and take his life and leave his nephew who’s in the same boat alone on the rough journey he’s on. He wanted to tell him that it gets better and it would have gotten better, and how it doesn’t matter who you love, just that you’re surrounded by positive and loving people.
The video attempt achieves its purpose by getting to its viewers through an emotional appeal. The video can relate to a lot of people that may be in the same position as him or the same one his uncle was in and help them get through a difficult time in their lives. This man wanted to get his point across and at the same time let out his feelings to his uncle, he wants people to know that its okay to be scared, he is too, but that it will get better in the end. 
The structure of the message was shown in a very real way I would say. He used a lot of the feelings and situations/hardships many people go through when first dealing with being gay. I think the structure was good because people need to know that they are not alone, and by him including suicide and just coming out and confronting his uncle and being upset with him was a very appealing thing. Even though his uncle took his own life and left him alone, he refuses to think like that and make the best of his situation. Overall, the message and how it was presented was very good.
	This video’s structure can help me revise my Lived Experienced project because I will probably go back and try and take another approach. I might try and connect better with the topic and have a more personal appeal when talking about my own experiences and how they have influenced me.
