			<p>To learn more on what it takes to become a physician?s assistant and what I?m in store for in my future I interviewed my cousin, Sydney Lorey, who is in the process of getting her physician?s assistant license. She was very thorough and very helpful throughout the interviewing process and helped me enormously.  I asked her 6 questions, starting with what was your best experience you?ve has so far in regards to your major/becoming a physician?s assistant? She answered ?being able to shadow PA?s has allowed me to see the influence they on patient?s lives. Those experiences have confirmed to me that, that?s what kind of influence I want to be as a physician?s assistant?. My next question was, what class do you think helped you the most in your educational journey in becoming a PA?  To that question, Sydney answered ?I believe anatomy and physiology will be the most beneficial.  Nearly all physician assistants programs start with a review of anatomy and physiology so having some background should be beneficial. Also, taking a GRE prep was helpful in getting a good score into the program?. After hearing her answer, it helped reassure me of my career choice because anatomy and physiology was my favorite subject I?ve taken so far in my educational career. Anyone that is attracted to this subject is on the right path to choosing their future job or major. My third question was, what?s been you?re most rewarding experience so far during your journey and numerous experiences? She then answered, ?My most rewarding experience has definitely been working in a nursing home as a nurse aid. I was able to care for residents and make a difference?. If someone wants to go into the medical field because they want to help people and change lives for the better then her answer is just clarification that I, along with everyone else in the same position is on the correct path. As my fourth question I asked her, what has been the most useful thing that you?ve learned through college and throughout previous experiences? Sydney then answered ?The most useful thing I?ve learned was working as a nurse aid. I learned besides manner, how to talk and work with patients?. This shows that during internships and being out there in the real world and putting your knowledge to every day use is when you learn the most and gain your most meaningful experiences, and also how to work in various environments. For my fifth question, I decided to ask, what could I expect going into PA school and internships on a regular basis? Her response was, ?what to expect is asking professors and health care providers for letters of recommendation, writing and rewriting personal statements, researching programs that you meet the qualifications for, and going to 6 hour interviews with groups of 20 or more of your peers and competition?. This inside look at what I can expect in my future can help me in preparing myself and others, so we are not going in blind and have somewhat of an idea of what we are getting ourselves in to. My sixth and final question was asking her what advice she could give me for the future. In her final response she told me that, ? as far as advice goes, I would recommend either getting CAN or EMT training as soon as you can and to find a PA to follow. Make sure you?re getting all the classes you need to apply to the programs, most of them have different requirements which is why I had to stay an extra year?. It?s a great opportunity that I have a cousin that I can ask for advice and look up to while I attempt to follow in her footsteps, and it was a very rewarding experience getting to interview her. </p>
			<p>    As my second interview, I decided to question Robert Steinly who has mentored Sydney throughout her process of becoming a PA and taught her a lot of what she now knows about the medical field. I first asked him what made him to teach science classes and begin to be interested in the medical field. He answered, ?well, I have always been interested in medicine and how it affects people it various ways, but I also have also been interested in and had a taking to teaching. This way I get to interact with students and teach them useful things, helping them and at the same time helping their future patients by teaching them a lot of information that they will need to know and utilize in their futures?. My second question was, what aspects and actions do you notice in your most promising students that you find intriguing? Steinly then answered, ?I, as most people would think, realized fairly quickly that the students that raise their hands and come up to me before and after lecture are the ones that take their education most seriously are the ones that I can see as having the highest success rate and are most mature. Students with original questions and ones that come to me to tell me about their internship experiences are most intriguing?.  My third question had to do with him and his personal experiences in the medical field, I asked if he had and occasions, personally that led him to specialize in teaching about physician?s assistant and mentoring students? His response was, ?yes, over the years I have had numerous experiences with physician?s assistants. But the one that first got me interested was seeing how the PA?s interacted with my brother when he was in the hospital with cancer, they treated him exceptionally well and knew a lot about him and his disease, they seemed different and more personable than other specialists?. I could easily relate to this answer and him in this case, because my stepdad had cancer and when I went to the hospital, my family and I got to know the physician?s assistants ten times better than we did any doctor or nurse that walked in and out of his room. PA?s relate to their patients way better, and tend to get to know their patients and grow a connection with them .  As my fourth question I asked him what made him decide to be a professor instead of a physician?s assistant himself. He then answered, ?well you know what they say young lady, those who can?t do, teach (with a chuckle), no I?m just messing with you. I decided I would fit better in the educational field, I love medicine and a social environment, however I have a passion for teaching and helping my students become more knowledgeable and making sure they understand the necessary material. It would have been amazing to become a physician?s assistant but I also enjoy the hours of a professor more than ones of a PA. They?re constantly on their toes and must be ready at any hour, I?m more of a set schedule kind of person and it just didn?t work with my personality and what I wanted as a career, so I chose teaching?. I respected his answer and could see where he was coming from, I think he touched on a good point that many striving to become a PA should think about, the hours are difficult and tedious and many need to be prepared for that kind of lifestyle as a career. My final question was asking him for any advice that he could think of that might be useful to me in the future. He then answered, ?I would advise you to be completely, 100% sure that this is the job field you want to go in to, and that you are doing it for the right reasons. Choose a career that you are excited to get up and go to every day, because you will become unhappy very quickly if you don?t like your job or have interest in it?. I was grateful for his advice, because especially going into a medical field, once you?re in there?s not much going back, especially if you are specializing in a certain area. Everyone should make sure that they will truly enjoy their job and are not just picking them for the money or because they think it sounds cool.</p>
