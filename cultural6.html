<p>The effects of the solution I would expect to be slow but sure. Obviously, there are people out there that enjoy their music, especially the artists, that won’t want to change and don’t care how the lyrics and videos affect society and it’s people. However, there will be the fair share that actually want a change and are interested in a more respectful music industry and society. All it takes is for a few people to start the movement and it will catch on, the domino effect will take place and I truly believe a change could happen.</p>
