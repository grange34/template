		<h1>Remix Project Memo</h1>
		
<p>The issue we chose affected our composition of the project because when discussing a universal problem such as, music affecting the outlook on women and behavior of men towards women, we needed various examples and points of view. To introduce our social issue we started out with a couple well-known and well criticized music videos and a news clip, we wanted our audience to get an idea of the type of music that’s influencing the world. As the video continues we added in descriptions of the point we wanted to get across on how artists are very influential people that numerous teens look up to and use their actions to model their own behavior. By music videos and lyrics being so degrading it gives women an excuse to act in promiscuous ways and also allows men to treat them as objects and not respectfully.  We then interviewed a couple different groups of people and asked them a series of questions getting their opinions on music, their videos, and how much sexuality of women contributes to music’s sales.  We attempted to set up our video in the most affective way to get our point across and in a way that flowed. The composing of this issue helped me learn more about the social problem by getting the chance to interview people and learn each of their different point of views and opinions on the topic. It also gave me a chance to research more on the topic and see how harshly the news criticizes certain videos and songs. In organizing and putting together our video we came across difficulties in getting worthy responses to our interview questions and uploading the different videos and converting them from computer to computer. There weren’t too many difficulties in putting the documentary together; just choosing what would fit best and best represent our topic. The audience played a major role in our project because we wanted them to understand our issue and get through to them that degrading women and over sexual videos weren’t tasteful or okay. At the same time we wanted to make sure that it kept their attention and was entertaining with the music and a subject they could relate to. </p>
	<p>We selected our topic by discussing the previous papers we had wrote about and picking what would be most interesting to write about. Quickly, we decided that we wanted to go with the social issue direction and soon picked one of my old papers based on how rap music and their videos degrade women and affect the behavior of men and women around the world. The most challenging part of the project was definitely trying to get the whole group together and figuring out who was going to what for the video and interviews. We didn’t really take a systematic approach, we just did what we could get done at an efficient time while it still would turn out good. </p>
<p>	The research sources that were most useful to us were YouTube and Google to help us look up news clips and music videos as well as songs for background music. These references might be very basic, but they are always a great deal of help. I don’t really think we had non-beneficial research sources; any one that we used was helpful to us in some kind of way. The websites that helped with video editing were helpful and taught us different ways to combine our videos. 
	Honestly, our group interacting while completing this project was not very good. Not once did we all get together as an entire group and that made the whole thing very difficult. Some people didn’t exactly do their part in this project, and some did more than others. I don’t believe the work was well spread out but in the end we did complete the task and I am happy with our video. Working, as a group was not fruitful in any way, I don’t like to work in groups or rely on other people for my grade. If one person doesn’t do something right or decides to not put in much work it affects the whole group and makes everyone look bad and I’m definitely not a fan of that. </p>
<p>	I think that we planned out our video very well actually. We set it up so we knew what we were going to do and that we were going to interview certain people and we basically knew what the video would contain. The timing did not turn out as well as we planned it to, however. If I had had more time and could do it over again I would make sure our entire group got together more and started putting the video together quicker and I would have had it containing more videos and music. 
<p>	The most effective aspect of our documentary’s design would be our flow of videos, to text, to interviews. It changes the layout of the documentary every couple minutes and keeps it interesting. Our main point and issue gets addressed and explained thoroughly and can keep an audience’s attention. We made our design decisions by picking music and videos that were recent and got a lot of recognition and using the text to get our specific points across, and at the same time using interviews to get a real life point of view from real people.  We wanted to get our issue across in various ways that our audience could understand and I think we accomplished that goal. </p>
