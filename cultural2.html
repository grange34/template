<p>In this day and age, many societal issues exist in the world. They range from miniscule to a complete change in behavior from the days of our parents and previous generations. A problem that needs to be paid more attention to would have to be how music videos, particularly rap, degrade and clearly disrespect women. It has quite obviously, taken a toll on our generation greatly and I’m sure many more after ours if a change doesn’t happen. Music is a way of life for teenagers and kids now a days that when they see their favorite artists sing, rap, and talk about women in such a manner, that they think it’s okay to treat them like objects, and it gives women an excuse to behave in ways that are not respectful to themselves. In the past, artists sang with and rapped with passion about personal experiences and songs had meaning, now music companies are only focused on what will sell and what has a good beat. No one really cares what is said about women or the way they are portrayed in musician’s music videos, girls are constantly referred to as “bitches” and “hoes” and no one turns an eye.  Men pride women in being promiscuous and in their songs want them to act in a certain way and is beginning to give women a bad name in general. Due to these videos and songs, girls think it’s okay to act in ways that will get men’s attention and men are now treating them as objects, not as ladies, and this is a problem.</p>
