		<h1>Music Takes Over Socetu</h1>
		
<p>In my paper I have decided to expose an important societal issue, which is that music videos, mainly rap, have disrespected women and now because men view them as objects and don’t treat them as ladies, women no longer behave as ones. There are multiple songs and videos that support my stance on this issue. Songs such as “Bitches Ain’t Shit”, “I Wanna Love You”, and “U.O.E.N.O.” depict women to be very promiscuous and unrealistic and degrade them in multiple ways. The lyrics are revolting and repeatedly talk down to the girls in the song and treat them horribly. Videos such as “Blurred Lines” have recently gotten a lot of attention and critiqued harshly for being too “rapey” and for they way the video depicts the women. Many other people actually have the same stance on this issue as I do, so there is hope for a change in the way our generation views women and music. The main issue isn’t just the songs, but the affect it has on its listeners and viewers. The solution to this problem isn’t as easy and simple as people may think; making cleaner music is just a start but definitely not the whole solution. The damage is done to our society, and it’s to the point where it’s not that easily reversed. For a real solution to happen, the men and teenagers of our time need to change their view on women and treat them as equals. Women, in turn, need to behave like ladies and present themselves in a respectful manner. I’m sure eventually an affect will take place, but it will be slow. Many people won’t want a change in music because of how catchy it is now, especially the artists that make it. But all that needs to happen is a few people that want to change their views are interested and the rest will be a domino effect. </p>
<p>	In this day and age, many societal issues exist in the world. They range from miniscule to a complete change in behavior from the days of our parents and previous generations. A problem that needs to be paid more attention to would have to be how music videos, particularly rap, degrade and clearly disrespect women. It has quite obviously, taken a toll on our generation greatly and I’m sure many more after ours if a change doesn’t happen. Music is a way of life for teenagers and kids now a days that when they see their favorite artists sing, rap, and talk about women in such a manner, that they think it’s okay to treat them like objects, and it gives women an excuse to behave in ways that are not respectful to themselves. In the past, artists sang with and rapped with passion about personal experiences and songs had meaning, now music companies are only focused on what will sell and what has a good beat. No one really cares what is said about women or the way they are portrayed in musician’s music videos, girls are constantly referred to as “bitches” and “hoes” and no one turns an eye.  Men pride women in being promiscuous and in their songs want them to act in a certain way and is beginning to give women a bad name in general. Due to these videos and songs, girls think it’s okay to act in ways that will get men’s attention and men are now treating them as objects, not as ladies, and this is a problem.</p>
<p>	To support and verify my stand on this issue, I went to YouTube and Google and found numerous songs that are degrading towards women. Some of the worst songs include “Bitches Ain’t Shit” by Snoop Dogg, “Wildflower” by Ghostface Killah, “Heidi Hoe” by Common, “U.O.E.N.O.” by Rick Ross, and  “I Wanna Love You” by Akon, but the unedited version. These songs have been noted on top ten most degrading lists and on the dirtiest rap songs ever lists. The lyrics are just repulsive and even the song titles alone give you a clue of how the song is going to play out. “U.O.E.N.O.” is one of the most popular rap songs of 2013 that many teenagers know the lyrics to and sing along to at concerts and on the radio. In the lyrics it says “…put Molly all in her champagne, she ain’t even know it, I took her home and enjoyed that, she ain’t even know it…” talking about the latest date rape drug, Molly, and how it’s basically socially acceptable to drug girls at parties or bars and take advantage of them. Lyrics like these make it look okay to disrespect and engage in such horrible illegal activity. In the song “Bitches Ain’t Shit” Snoop Dogg insults women throughout the entire song for no reason, the lyrics “Bitches ain’t shit but hoes and tricks, lick on these n*** and suck the d***, get the f*** out after you’re done…”. This song is very well known, and the saying is still constantly use, the fact that the tune is catchy doesn’t help the matter either, and half the time people sing it without even realizing what they are saying. It’s a song that consistently puts down women and treats them as objects only good for doing sexual favors.  “I Wanna Love You” is also one of the songs that my generation still likes gives attention to. Akon only talks about how he throws money at the stripper he’s looking at and how he only wants to hook up with her. Putting strippers in songs and saying how hot they are does not put a good image or idea in girls minds, thinking they need to be promiscuous and slutty to get guys attention. </p>
<p>	Music videos, along with songs help prove my point as well. Within the past couple months, articles have been written about how these days videos are so degrading and misleading with and towards women. “Blurred Lines” by Robin Thicke has received a lot of criticism for his music video due to the fact that it portrays the girls to look dumb, not say a word, dance around provocatively, and get checked out by the artists. It makes it appear that women are only there to look pretty and behave the way men want them to.  There are many critical reviews of this music video in particular, but videos in general have reached a whole new level of raunchiness lately. Websites all over the internet have their own takes on this issue but one quote stood out to me "In music videos across the board there's widespread racism and sexism, specifically the sexualisation of black and ethnic minority women," says Lia Latchford of Rewind&Reframe. "Young women have told us that it has a real impact on their day-to-day lives. They're tired of messages that depict women as highly sexualized passive sex objects. Getting rid of one song won't solve the problem. It's a culture of racism and sexism that we need to change." (www.theguardian.com). This quote shows that many women are tired of being depicted as objects and want a change, and they realize that music videos and their lyrics are is what’s degrading them. </p>
<p>	The main issue that comes from music videos and their lyrics being so descriptive and degrading is the view men and teenagers are beginning to have of women and their expectations. Besides the fact that it’s disrespectful and just plain rude to speak about women in such a manner, it gives men an unrealistic view of women and portrays them as objects and not as people. They are beginning to expect and want women to act like the girls in the videos, men want girls to be promiscuous and slutty and encourage that behavior like it’s a normal every day thing. The sad part about all of it is that girls are starting to conform to these standards, they no longer have respect for themselves and don’t act like ladies. It’s beginning to seem like women aren’t even treated as equals any more, just utilized for sex and to be talked down to.  Our generation is changing before our eyes, and not for the better, I can only imagine what the future generations will look like if music and its videos stay the way they are. </p>
<p>	The solution to this problem isn’t as simple as some may think. Making cleaner music videos and less degrading songs is definitely a start, but it cannot be the solution alone. The damage is ultimately done; our generation and society have already been exposed to the demeaning videos and lyrics that have placed a certain image in their heads. Therefore, taking the cause away is not going to remove the effect that’s has been caused; there is not just a one step solution to a societal problem like this. People’s views entirely need to alter; men need to start respecting women and not treating them as objects and refrain from referring to them as “bitches” and “hoes”.  As a result, if men aren’t giving women attention for being promiscuous their actions will stop as well. If men respect women and expect lady like actions from them, it will rub off and women will start acting like ladies again. Also, if women only act like ladies, men won’t have a choice but to respect them because if they don’t, then the woman will find a man that does. The solution lies in altering the way videos are made, songs are written, and most importantly the changing of the view points of the people exposed and also in the changing of their behavior. </p>
<p>	The effects of the solution I would expect to be slow but sure. Obviously, there are people out there that enjoy their music, especially the artists, that won’t want to change and don’t care how the lyrics and videos affect society and it’s people. However, there will be the fair share that actually want a change and are interested in a more respectful music industry and society. All it takes is for a few people to start the movement and it will catch on, the domino effect will take place and I truly believe a change could happen.</p>
<p>	At the end of the day, there are many issues in society at this moment in time, but the way music, including it’s lyrics and videos, degrade women and affect our generations views is extremely important. Teenagers value their music greatly now a day, and they take hints from the music and apply it to their lives. By songs degrading women, it makes it look like it’s okay to treat them as objects and therefore gives women a reason to behave in a way that’s not respectful to themselves. Due to these popular songs and the affect they’re having, our generation is changing, and not for the better. There needs to be a change, and it needs to happen fast. </p>
