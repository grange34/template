		<h1>Music Takes Over Society</h1>


<p>	In my paper I have decided to expose an important societal issue, which is that music videos, mainly rap, have disrespected women and now because men view them as objects and don’t treat them as ladies, women no longer behave as ones. There are multiple songs and videos that support my stance on this issue. Songs such as “Bitches Ain’t Shit”, “I Wanna Love You”, and “U.O.E.N.O.” depict women to be very promiscuous and unrealistic and degrade them in multiple ways. The lyrics are revolting and repeatedly talk down to the girls in the song and treat them horribly. Videos such as “Blurred Lines” have recently gotten a lot of attention and critiqued harshly for being too “rapey” and for they way the video depicts the women. Many other people actually have the same stance on this issue as I do, so there is hope for a change in the way our generation views women and music. The main issue isn’t just the songs, but the affect it has on its listeners and viewers. The solution to this problem isn’t as easy and simple as people may think; making cleaner music is just a start but definitely not the whole solution. The damage is done to our society, and it’s to the point where it’s not that easily reversed. For a real solution to happen, the men and teenagers of our time need to change their view on women and treat them as equals. Women, in turn, need to behave like ladies and present themselves in a respectful manner. I’m sure eventually an affect will take place, but it will be slow. Many people won’t want a change in music because of how catchy it is now, especially the artists that make it. But all that needs to happen is a few people that want to change their views are interested and the rest will be a domino effect. </p>
